# 📅 Day Planner App

A minimal, distraction-free **daily planning app** built using **Flutter**. The app helps users plan their day, manage tasks with time slots, and build consistency using an automatic daily reset mechanism.

This project is designed as a **real-world learning app** focusing on product thinking, clean UI, and practical Flutter concepts.

## ▶️ How It Works

### Task Flow

1. User adds a task using **Add Task** screen
2. Task is saved locally using `SharedPreferences`
3. Tasks are automatically sorted by start time
4. Long‑press on a task shows Edit/Delete options

### Daily Reset Logic

* On app launch:

  * Checks last reset time
  * If current time is past **9:00 PM** and reset hasn’t happened today:

    * Clears tasks
    * Adds **Plan Your Day** task
